finalizing the remaining screens and implementing full CRUD functionality using the useContext hook and localStorage. All screens must be fully responsive.
The screens to be designed include:
Products
Categories
Users
Login and Register (for inventory owners to create and access their accounts)
Only the admin should have access to the Users routes, and make sure all routes are protected for non-logged-in users. Lastly, add a dark theme to your assignment.
Key note: CRUD functionality is required for products, users, and categories.
